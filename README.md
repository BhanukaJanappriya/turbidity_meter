# ðŸ’§ Image-Based Water Turbidity Estimation

This is a 2nd-year **image processing project** that presents a low-cost, image-based approach for estimating **water turbidity** using fundamental image processing techniques in Python. It provides an alternative to traditional laboratory devices like nephelometers, enabling quick, low-cost, and portable turbidity analysis using only a camera and basic computing tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The project analyzes captured images of water samples and computes their turbidity levels using metrics derived from:

- **Grayscale intensity analysis**
- **Edge detection**
- **Region segmentation**
- **Red channel analysis**
- **Empirical calibration models**

The system also allows for calibration using known NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units) samples and supports both simple and complex exponential turbidity prediction models.
